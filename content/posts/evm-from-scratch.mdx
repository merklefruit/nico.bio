## First principles: What is the EVM?

You can skip this section if you want to jump to the implementation details!

Let's start with simple principles: If the Ethereum Protocol was a computer, then the EVM would be its
operating system, and smart contracts would be the programs running on it. Computers are deterministic:
this means that if you give exactly the same input to a computer, you will always get the same output.
This is also why generating random numbers [is so hard](https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/).

For Ethereum smart contracts to work on a huge network of potentially hundreds of millions of computers across
the world, we need to be sure that the software running on every single one is deterministic and will give
the expected output every time. For this to happen on any machine independently of its processor architecture,
memory blueprint or other hardware differences, we need to abstract away the program's execution from the
hardware. This is where virtual machines come into play.

In particular, the Ethereum Virtual Machine contains the set of instructions that are supported by
the protocol and the rules that control the interactions between different smart contracts, transfer
of value, memory or storage access, and more.

## How is the EVM laid out?

The official source of truth for the EVM implementation is
the [Ethereum yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).
There are a lot of [useful resources](https://github.com/merklefruit/evm-from-scratch/blob/main/daily-progress/day00.md)
explaining its layout, as well as multiple complete implementations in different languages:

- [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/evm.go): Go
- [py-evm](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm): Python
- [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone): C++
- [ethereumjs-evm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/evm): Typescript
- [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm): Rust

On its core, the EVM is a stack-based virtual machine with a 32 byte word size and 1024 stack depth.
The word size was chosen because it can perfectly fit a Keccak256 hash (256 bit),
which is the hash primitive used for the Ethereum protocol, as well as allowing easy 256-bit integer arithmetic.

Other than the stack, the single EVM execution context includes many other entities, such as memory,
storage, transaction data, block data, call data, return data and more.

The memory is defined as an ephemeral infinitely-extensible byte array which starts empty at the beginning
of each execution. In practice, there is a quadratic cost associated with expanding memory, so it
is not possible to consume more than a limited amount of it.

The storage is a key-value store holding data about each account indexed by address.
The data is stored in the form of 256-bit words. The storage is a part of the state of
the blockchain and is updated by the transactions. The way this works is by keeping track of
the global state via keeping the root hash of the state Merkle tree in each block header.
[I wrote more about this here](https://github.com/merklefruit/evm-from-scratch/blob/main/daily-progress/day12.md).

## What operations can the EVM do?

A full reference of all the EVM assembly instructions can be found [here](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=grayGlacier).
For my own implementation, I followed [this categorization of instructions](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/gray_glacier/vm/instructions/index.html):

- Arithmetic: basic integer arithmetic
- Bitwise Logic: simple logic gates
- Block: access block information
- Comparison: compare integer values
- Control Flow: alter the program counter conditionally
- Environmental: access calldata, code, return data, balance and other transaction info
- Keccak: hash functions
- Logging: on-chain event logs creation
- Memory: read or write from memory
- Stack: stack operations such as push or pop
- Storage: read or write from transient storage
- System: call sub-execution contexts, create new ethereum accounts
